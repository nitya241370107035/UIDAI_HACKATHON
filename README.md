Aadhaar Demographic Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Description

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Aadhaar demographic data to identify age-wise population patterns, district-level disparities, and time-based trends across India. The analysis uses statistical methods and visualizations to uncover meaningful demographic insights that support data-driven understanding and decision-making.

Dataset Used

The dataset contains Aadhaar demographic information with the following columns:

State – State name

District – District name

Pincode – Area-level identifier

demo_age_5_17 – Demographic count for age group 5–17

demo_age_17_ – Demographic count for age group 17+

Date – Record date

Total Records: 1.59 million+

Analysis Performed

Univariate Analysis (distribution, skewness, outliers)

Bivariate Analysis (correlation between age groups)

Trivariate and Multivariate Analysis (state, district, age-group interactions)

Time-series trend analysis

District-level and state-level comparative analysis

Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Key Outcomes

Identified strong correlation between child and adult demographics

Observed significant district-level and state-level disparities

Detected extreme skewness and outliers in demographic distributions

Highlighted temporal variations in demographic activity

Conclusion

The analysis provides a structured understanding of Aadhaar demographic patterns across India and demonstrates how EDA can be used to transform large-scale government data into actionable insights.
